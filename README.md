# Task 1: Rule-Based AI Bot

## Project Description
This is a deterministic, rule-based AI assistant developed as part of my internship at **DecodeLabs**. The bot utilizes efficient string sanitization and Python dictionary mapping to act as a robust conversational guardrail. It guarantees 100% hallucination-free, safe, and accurate responses based on predefined organizational knowledge and interactive intents.

## Key Features
- **Deterministic Guardrails:** Hard-coded logic ensures safe and secure interactions.
- **Input Sanitization:** Automatically handles trailing spaces and case insensitivity (`.strip().lower()`).
- **Graceful Fallback:** Uses `.get()` methodology to provide an intuitive fallback message when an unknown query is entered.
- **Interactive Loop:** Includes a continuous conversation loop with clear exit strategies (`exit`, `quit`, `bye`).

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Core Concepts:** Dictionaries, Infinite Loops, Conditional Flow, Data Sanitization
